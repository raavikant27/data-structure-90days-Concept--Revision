// Approach:
// Two pointers are set up to define the search space â€” one pointing to the beginning of the array and the other to the end.
// The middle element of the current search space is found and the search space is repeatedly divided in half:
// If the middle element matches the target, the index is returned.
// If the target is greater than the middle element, the search space is narrowed to the right half.
// If the target is smaller, the search space is narrowed to the left half.
// If the loop ends without finding the target, return -1 indicating that the target is not present in the array.
