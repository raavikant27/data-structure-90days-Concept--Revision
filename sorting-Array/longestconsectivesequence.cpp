// Intuition
// One simple approach is to look for sequences of consecutive numbers by utilising linear search in the array. For each number 洧논 in the array, we'll check if the next numbers like 洧논+1, 洧논+2, 洧논+3, and so on, are also in the array. This is like checking if we can build a chain of numbers that follow each other directly. By doing this for every number in the array, we can find the longest chain of consecutive numbers. Finally, we'll find the length of the longest chain among all the numbers in the array.

// Approach
// As you iterate through each number in the array, begin by checking if consecutive numbers like ( x+1, x+2, x+3 ), and so on, exist in the array. The occurrence of the next consecutive number can be checked by using linear search.
// When you find consecutive numbers, start counting them using a counter. Increment this counter each time you find the next consecutive number in the sequence.
// This counter effectively keeps track of how long the current consecutive sequence is as you move through the array and find more consecutive numbers.
